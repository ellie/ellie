# Hey! I'm Ellie 👋

I make things! Here's a few:

- 🐢 a shell history sync + search tool [[atuin]](https://github.com/ellie/atuin)
- 🔉 a modified [iPod](https://ellie.wtf/ipod/)
- ⌨️ a [keyboard](https://ellie.wtf/my-planck-keyboard/)
- 🦔 open source things at [PostHog](https://posthog.com)
- 🏍️ a mastodon instance, [bikers.social](https://app.bikers.social)

I like to write about what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I'm doing with my life. You can read more here: [ellie.wtf](https://ellie.wtf)

Otherwise, my interests include [motorcycles](https://instagram.com/ellie.bikes), [photography](https://instagram.com/shotbyellie), and just generally tinkering with things.
